# SpmImages.jl

A julia library to read and display SPM (scanning probe microscopy) images. Currently, only Nanonis files are supported.

The commands are somewhat similar to the ones in the respective python version [imag*ex*](https://github.com/alexriss/imagex).

## Installation

The library is not listed in the Julia package registry, but it can be easily installed by:

```julia
pkg> add "https://github.com/alexriss/SpmImages.jl"
```

## Getting started

Code examples can be found in the [example notebook](demo/example.ipynb).
